# ᚦᚢᛝᚱ

Thungr (ᚦᚢᛝᚱ in runes) is a Old Norse for 'heavy'. It is a 5th Edition D&D campaign with a theme, story, and setting, inspired by heavy metal music, culture, and artwork. It is a mixture of sci-fi and fantasy with an emphasis on the epic where the gods, demons, and other elder beings are iconic characters from metal music. Expect to see Eddie the Destroy, The Four Horsemen, and Dio.

## Character Concepts

Very little backstory is required of the characters. They will awaken in a crashed spaceship with no recollection of who they are or how they got here. They will know their names and capabilities, and will have a deep sense of purpose. They know they are part of a team and that they are guardians, sent out to confront... something. They are here for a reason, but they don't know what that reason is.

Characters will be made with core classes and races from the Player's Handbook. That said, they can easily be reskinned to make them more epic and techy. Think outside of the box and see how the rules can be applied. Want to play a cyborg warrior? No problem. Your weapons might be part of your body, but they still work the same. Looking to play a Hanover Fiste like character who gets big and strong? Sounds like a Barbarian to me!

## Rules

ᚦᚢᛝᚱ is a very atypical D&D game and—accordingly—has some rather atypical rules. Some of these are derived from the awesome games ICRPG and 5E Hardcore Mode from [Runehammer Games](https://www.runehammer.online/). Others are devised from the musing of Professor Dungeon Master's wonderful YouTube channel [Dungeon Craft](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD6ERRdXrF2IZ0R888G8PQg). Some are of my creation.

All of these together are likely to have balance issues and odd or poorly thought out corners. I strive to be loose and generous with the rules. If it's not working, we'll figure it out and keep it fun!
