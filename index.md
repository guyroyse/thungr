# ᚦᚢᛝᚱ

Thungr (ᚦᚢᛝᚱ in runes) is a metal fantasy campaign.

## Overview

- Mixed setting of scifi and fantasy.
- Inspired by heavy metal music, culture, and artwork.
- Epic in scope with larger than life characters, locations, and artifacts.
- Gods, demons, and other elder beings are iconic characters from metal music.
- Players are bad but not the bad guys.

## Rules

ᚦᚢᛝᚱ is a very atypical D&D game and—accordingly—has some rather atypical rules. Some of these are derived from the awesome games ICRPG and 5E Hardcore Mode from [Runehammer Games](https://www.runehammer.online/). Others are devised from the musing of Professor Dungeon Master's wonderful YouTube channel [Dungeon Craft](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD6ERRdXrF2IZ0R888G8PQg). Some are of my creation.

All of these together are likely to have balance issues and odd or poorly thought out corners. I strive to be loose and generous with the rules. If it's not working, we'll figure it out and keep it fun!
