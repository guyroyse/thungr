# Money

There are copper, silver, gold, and platinum coins worth the standard values in D&D. There are no electrum coins because they're tedious and annoying. [Yogstones](yogstones) can also be used as currency. A yogstone is worth 10 platinum for every heart it has.

- a single-heart yogstone = 10 platinum coins
- 1 platinum coin = 10 gold coins
- 1 gold coin = 10 silver coins
- 1 silver coin = 10 copper coins

Coins are about the size of dimes and weigh one-tenth of an ounce. Just like silver dimes.
