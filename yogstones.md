# Yogstones

Yogstones are glowing red crystals the are used to indistinguishably power magic and technology. Most yogstones are a single heart and are consumed by spellcasters and by personal equipment. Others are larger and are used to power vehicles, cities, and starships.

Typically, a yogstone looses a hit point when a character rolls a critical failure. When all of a yogstones hitpoints are gone, the glow fades and the crystal becomes brittle.
