# House Rules

We'll be using the follow house rules.

## Current Target

There are no hidden armor classes or target numbers. All rolls will be made against a visible target number that will be used for everything. Want to thwack the goblin? Roll against the target. Want to climb the wall? Roll against the target.

Some actions can be *hard* or *easy*. *Hard* tasks add three to the target. *Easy* tasks subtract three. You roll against the target to hit the goblins but the bugbear boss is *hard* to hit. And the giant rat companions are *easy* to hit.

## Timers

A visible 1d4 is rolled turning encounters. On the DM's turn, it turned down by one. Once it is removed, something happens to escalate the current situation.

## Initiative

Initiative is based on marching order. Everyone rolls. Whomever wins goes first and then play continues down the line.

## Rooms and Zones

*Rooms* are tactical locations such as the Bridge of Khazad-dûm or Shelob's Lair. They are made up of one or more *zones* and have a target number. Don't let the word *room* confuse you, this could be outdoors.

A *zone* is a part of a *room*. It could be a bridge, a copse of trees, or a section of crowded stacks in a library.

During combat, *rooms* and *zones* have the following rules:

- Anyone within a *zone* can attack and be attacked by anyone else in that *zone*.
- Anyone in a *room* can attack anyone else in the *room* with a ranged weapon.
- Reach weapons give advantage if you are fighting against someone who doesn't have one.
- Attacks with two-handed ranged weapons within a *zone* are at disadvantage.

## Regions and Sites

*Regions* are navigable pieces of terrain in the world such as the Misty Mountains or Murkwood. *Regions* usually have *sites*. They have a target number and a travel time (often a roll, sometimes with special rules) showing how long it takes to traverse them.

A *site* is a destination within an *region* such as Minas Morgul or Bree.

To move across regions, exit a region, or move between sites within a region:

1. Expend the number of days defined for the region (probably a roll) to find a known *site* within an *region* or to traverse an *region*.
2. Check for random encounters as per the region.
3. Check to see if characters are lost.
4. If they are lost, go to step 1 and repeat until they get where they are going or are dead.
5. If they are not lost, then they have arrived.

When searching for a *site* the characters haven't been to before, rolls are made with disadvantage. Maps of a *region* provide advantage when navigating and negate the disadvantage of seeking an unfamiliar site.

A **critical success** means the journey takes half the time. A **critical failure** results in some sort of bad outcome or event left to DM fiat.

## Casting Spells

Yogstones are the divine or arcane focus for all spellcasting. They are required for all spells and all casters, even if they don't have a material component cost. However, they do not need to be held or manipulated. They just need to be on your person. So, if a verbal-only spell is cast, the yogstone can stay in your pocket. But if you don't have it, the verbal only spell is not able to be cast. For a yogstones to work as a focus, it must have a least one charge left.

When casting a spell, if you must roll to cast—say for a ranged spell attack—and get a critical failure, one charge of the yogstone is consumed.

### Yogstones and Spell Slots

Spells can be enhanced by using a higher-level slot to cast them. This is the stock rule in the Player's Handbook. However, you can also use a yogstone to enhance increase the casting level of a spell without using a higher-level slot. For each charge expended, increase the spell level by one.

- All charges must come from the same yogstone.
- You do not have to be able to casts spells of that level.
- You can also push it past 9th level.

 For example, a 5th level wizard casting fireball could spend 5 charges to make it an 8th-level fireball. They could spend all 10 to make it is 13th-level fireball.

You can also use the technique to cast spells when you don't want to use a slot. Want to cast a 3rd-level spell? Expend 3 charges. Want to enhance it? Spend more!

Doing either of these requires a roll against the current target. Roll 1d20 + your spellcasting ability + your proficiency bonus.

- **Success**: The spell goes off as desired and the charges _are_ expended.
- **Critical Success**: The spell goes off as desired and the charges _are not_ expended.
- **Failure**: The spell doesn't go off and the charges _are not_ expended.
- **Critical Failure**: The spell goes awry, something bad happens, and the charges _are_ expended.

## Hearts & Effort

A *heart* represents 10 points. This could be hit points, charges, or effort. Monsters and objects have *hearts* representing hit points. Yogstones have *hearts* representing charges. And tasks can have *hearts* representing effort to completion.

A task performed under duress (i.e combat) could be a straight up roll—success or failure—but it could have *hearts*. When performing a task with *hearts* roll as normal. On success, you have completed 1d6 points of effort. On failure, you make no progress. When all the points are gone, the task is completed.

This works well for dramatic situations. Picking a lock blocking your escape while your companions hold off the horde, extracting the data from a device before the detonator blows, or scrambling up a cliff to escape an approaching torrent of acid.

## If You Ain't First, You're Last

For anything you are proficient it, resolve all rolls with:

_1d20 + ability + the character's proficiency bonus_

For anything you are not proficient in, roll 1d20. If you have a negative ability modifier, include that too.

## Grit Yer Teeth

As a bonus action in combat you can expend a hit die. Make a *Constitution* save vs. the target number. Success means you can use a hit die and recover the hit points.
