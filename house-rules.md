# House Rules

We'll be using the follow house rules.

## Current Target

There are no hidden armor classes or target numbers. All rolls will be made against a visible target number that will be used for everything. Want to thwack the goblin? Roll against the target. Want to climb the wall? Roll against the target.

Some actions can be *hard* or *easy*. *Hard* tasks add three to the target. *Easy* tasks subtract three. You roll against the target to hit the goblins but the bugbear boss is *hard* to hit. And the giant rat companions are *easy* to hit.

## Timers

A visible 1d4 is often rolled turning encounters. On the DM's turn, it turned down by one. Once it is removed, something bad happens.

## Initiative

Initiative is based on marching order. Everyone rolls. Whomever wins goes first and then play continues down the line.

## Movement

We don't keep close track of movement. Movement is in zones. To cross a zone, you move. To cross two zones, you dash. You can attack anyone in the zone you are in. Reach weapons give advantage if you are fighting against someone who doesn't have one.

## Hearts & Effort

A *heart* represents 10 hit points. Monsters and objects have *hearts**. Yogstones have *hearts*.

And sometimes tasks performed under duress—like, say combat—can have *hearts* too. When performing such a task, such as picking a lock or disarming a trap, a check is made. On success, 1d6 points of "damage" is done against that task. When all the points are gone, the task is completed.

## If You Ain't First, You're Last

For anything you are proficient it, resolve all rolls with:

_1d20 + ability + the character's proficiency bonus_

For anything you are not proficient in, roll 1d20. If you have a negative ability modifier, include that too.

## Grit Yer Teeth

As a bonus action in combat you can expend a hit die. Make a *constitution* save vs. the target number. Success means you can use a hit die and recover the hit points.
