# Character Creation

The game world for Thungr is epic. It is inspired by heavy metal music and the associated artwork. It blends science fiction and fantasy elements to increase the _coolness_ of the characters and the setting. You will want to design your characters accordingly.

## Starting Level, Classes, and Races

You start at 1st level. Any race or class is permissible. Be creative and reskin races and classes to make your character. Want to play a nimble blue-skinned warrior with psychic abilities? This could be a reskinned elven paladin.

## Skills

All the normal skills are available. However, as the characters know nothing about the world they are about to explore, History will not be very useful.

## Languages

Use the standard array of languages. If you're reskinning a race to be something else, change the starting languages as appropriate.

## Additional Proficiencies

Since there are science fiction elements to this game, there are some additional things that proficiencies can do.

**Vehicles**: Proficiency with land and water vehicles extends to trucks, airboats, motorcycles, and all the crazy variants that might be encountered. Your character can also be proficient with aerospace vehicles, allowing them to pilot aircraft and spacecraft.

**Tools**: Proficiency with *mechanic's tools* allow you to repair machines, such as the aforementioned vehicles. Proficiency with *hacker's tools* allows you to hack, infiltrate, and extract information from computers.

## Backgrounds

Feel free to get creative with this. Swap out the tool and skill proficiencies as makes sense for your character. Do not take any of the equipment.

## Rolling Abilities

You don't. Pick one of the following sets of abilities and assign as desired.

| Option 1 | Option 2 | Option 3 | Option 4 |
|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
|  17 +3   |  17 +3   |  17 +3   |  18 +4   |
|  15 +2   |  16 +3   |  15 +2   |  15 +2   |
|  14 +2   |  13 +1   |  13 +1   |  14 +2   |
|  13 +1   |  12 +1   |  12 +1   |  13 +1   |
|  11  0   |  11  0   |  11  0   |  11  0   |
|   9 -1   |   9 -1   |  10  0   |   7 -2   |

## Speed

Your speed is measured in zones (read more about zones in the [house rules](house-rules)) and you have separate numbers for a Move and a Dash. For most characters, their Move is 1 and their Dash is 2. However, if your characters has an enhanced speed (like a monk) then apply the following rules:

- If you have a speed of 40' or more, you have a Move of 2 and a Dash of 3
- If you have a speed of 55' or more, you have a Move of 2 and a Dash of 4.

If you're faster than this, you're a monster.

## Equipment

Characters start with no currency and the following items:

- an enhanced primary weapon (and 50 rounds of ammunition for it)
- a standard secondary weapon (and 20 rounds of ammunition for it)
- medium or lighter armor
- clothing

- pouch containing:
  - 2 potions of healing
  - 3 yogstones

- backpack containing:
  - bedroll
  - canteen
  - mess kit
  - glow globe
  - healer's kit
  - 5 days of rations
  - fire starter

- one set of tools, a kit, a gaming set, or a musical instrument

Weapons deserve special attention as this is a science fantasy settings and there are blasters and light sabers alongside longbows and battle axes. We could detail a bunch of weapons, but that would be tedious and time consuming. So, we'll just get creative and make our own weapons by reskinning the existing ones to make cool new ones.

### Standard Weapons

Standard weapons are just that, standard. They work as written in the rules. A short bow is a standard weapon that does 1d6 piercing damage. These can be reskinned. For example, a short bow could be skinned as a shotgun and still do 1d6 piercing damage.

You can also change the damage type with a standard weapon. Change the damage on the shotgun to slashing and you've got flechette gun. Change it to fire and you have a flamer. Change it to force or radiant and you have a blaster.

### Enhanced Weapons

Enhanced weapons are enhanced with yogstones. They can be skinned just like standard weapons. But the yogstones make them something more. In addition to a standard weapon you can:

_Add a 1d6 of damage of any type to the weapon. So, the aforementioned blaster could do 1d6 force and 1d6 radiant damage._

OR

_For ranged weapons, eliminate the need to supply ammunition and remove the two-handed trait from weapons that do not have the heavy trait. So, the flamer would still only do 1d6 fire damage but it wouldn't require ammunition and it would become a one-handed weapon._

Yogstones are consumed over time. Every time a critical failure is rolled, the yogstone looses a charge. When the charges are gone, the yogstone goes dim and no longer powers the weapon.

### Sample Weapons

Get as creative with your gear as you'd like. Here are some examples:

- **Longsword**: It's just a longsword. It does 1d8 slashing and doesn't require a yogstone.

- **Carbine**: It's a two-handed short-barrelled gun. It's really a short bow.

- **Blaster**: Pistol that fires bolts of force. It's really a short bow that does 1d6 force damage. It requires a yogstone to power it, doesn't require ammunition, and is a one-handed weapon.

- **Blast Rifle**: Rifle that fires bolts of force. It's really a longbow that does 1d8 force damage. It requires a yogstone to power it, doesn't require ammunition and, remains a two-handed weapon as it is heavy.

- **Flaming Sword**: A sword that is engulfed in flames. It's really a longsword that does 1d8 slashing damage and 1d6 fire damage. It requires a yogstone.

- **Electric Slugthrower**: Shoots bullets that have small but potent electrical charges in them. It's really a short bow that does 1d6 piercing damage and an extra 1d6 lightning damage. It requires ammunition and a yogstone to power it.

- **Disruptor Sword**: A blade of black energy that rots flesh. It's really a short sword that does 2d6 necrotic damage. It requires a yogstone.

## Spells

Yogstones are the divine or arcane focus for all spellcasting. You can [read more about this](house-rules) in the house rules.

Feel free to create spell variations by changing the damage type. Want to be able to cast a frostball instead of a fireball? Have at it. Just change the damage type and you've created a new spell. Yes, this means clerics have more spells to choose from.
