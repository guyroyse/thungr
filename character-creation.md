# Character Creation

The game world for Thungr is epic. It is inspired by heavy metal music and the associated artwork. It blends science fiction and fantasy elements to increase the _coolness_ of the characters and the setting.

## Character Concepts

Very little backstory is required of the characters. They will awaken in a crashed spaceship with no recollection of who they are or how they got here. They will know their names and capabilities, and will have a deep sense of purpose. They are the heroes, they are a team, and there is evil to confront. But while they are here for a reason, they don't know what that reason is.

Characters will need to be made with the standard D&D rules. That said, they can easily be reskinned to make them more epic and techy. Think outside of the box and see how the rules can be applied. Want to play a cyborg warrior? No problem. Your weapons might be part of your body, but they still work the same.

## Starting Level, Classes, and Races

You start at 1st level. Any race or class is permissible. Be creative and reskin races and classes to make your character. Want to play a nimble blue-skinned warrior with psychic abilities? This could be a reskinned elven paladin.

## Skills

All the normal skills are availabe. However, as the characters know nothing about the world they are about to explore, history will not be useful at all.

## Rolling Abilities

You don't. Pick one of the following sets of abilities and assign as desired.

| Option 1 | Option 2 | Option 3 | Option 4 |
|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
|  17 +3   |  17 +3   |  17 +3   |  18 +4   |
|  15 +2   |  16 +3   |  15 +2   |  15 +2   |
|  14 +2   |  13 +1   |  13 +1   |  14 +2   |
|  13 +1   |  12 +1   |  12 +1   |  13 +1   |
|  11  0   |  11  0   |  11  0   |  11  0   |
|   9 -1   |   9 -1   |  10  0   |   7 -2   |

## Equipment

Characters start with no currency and the following items:

- an enhanced primary weapon
- a standard secondary weapon
- medium or lighter armor
- 2 potions of healing
- 3 days of rations
- 3 days of water
- 3 hearts of yogstones

Weapons deserve special attention as this is a science fantasy settings and there are blasters and light sabers alongside longbows and battle axes. We could detail a bunch of weapons, but that would be tedious and time consuming. So, we'll just get creative and make our own weapons by reskinning the existing ones to make cool new ones.

### Standard Weapons

Standard weapons are just that, standard. They work as written in the rules. A shortbow is a standarad weapon that does 1d6 piercing damage. These can be reskinned. For example, a shortbow could be skinned as a shotgun and still do 1d6 piercing damage.

You can also change the damage type with a standard weapon. Change the damage on the shotgun to slashing and you've got flechette gun. Change it to fire and you have a flamer. Change it to force or radiant and you have a blaster.

### Enhanced Weapons

Enhanced weapons are enhanced with yogstones. They can be skinned just like stnadard weapons. But the yogstones make them something more. In addition to a standard weapon you can:

_Add a 1d6 of damage of any type to the weapon. So, the aforementioned blaster could do 1d6 force and 1d6 radiant damage._

OR

_For ranged weapons, eliminate the need to supply ammunition and remove the two-handed trait from weapons that have the heavy trait. So, the flamer would still only do 1d6 fire damage but it wouldn't require ammunition and it would become a one-handed weapon._

Yogstones which are consumed over time. Every time a critical failure is rolled, the yogstone looses a hit point. When the hit points are gone, the yogstone goes dim and no longer powers the weapon.

### Sample Weapons

Get as creative with your gear as you'd like. Here are some examples:

- **Longsword**: It's just a longsword. It does 1d8 slashing and doesn't require a yogstone.

- **Carbine**: It's a two-handed short-barrelled gun. It's really a shortbow.

- **Blaster**: Pistol that fires bolts of force. It's really a shortbow that does 1d6 force damage. It requires a yogstone to power it, doesn't require ammunition, and is a one-handed weapon.

- **Blast Rifle**: Rifle that fires bolts of force. It's really a longbow that does 1d8 force damage. It requires a yogstone to power it, doesn't require ammunition and, remains a two-handed weapon as it is heavy.

- **Flaming Sword**: A sword that is engulfed in flames. It's really a longsword that does 1d8 slashing damage and 1d6 fire damage. It requires a yogstone.

- **Electric Slugthrower**: Shoots bullets that have small but potent electrical charges in them. It's really a shortbow that does 1d6 piercing damage and an extra 1d6 lightning damage. It requires ammunition and a yogstone to power it.

- **Disruptor Sword**: A blade of black energy that rots flesh. It's really a shortsword that does 2d6 necrotic damage. It requires a yogstone.

## Spells

Spells follow the model in set forth in 5E Hardcore Mode by Runehammer Games. This model eliminates slots and variable spell effects.

All casters:

- Have access to spells of level equal to their character level. So a 3rd-level wizard has access to fireball.
- For spells with variable effects, they are cast at their native level. So, that 3rd-level fireball will always do 8d6 damage.

### Learning Spells

**Clerics**, **druids**, **paladins**, and **rangers** do not have to learn spells. They know all the spells available to their level. Yes, this means a 5th-level paladin has access to all their spells.

**Bards**, **sorcerers**, and **wizards** learn three spells of their level at each level. That means a 1st-level wizard knows three 1st-level spells and a 3rd-level wizard knows three 1st-level spells, three 2nd-level spells, and three 3rd-level spells.

**Warlocks** learn a single spell of their level at each level but keep all of their invocations.

### Preparing Spells

**Clerics**, **druids**, **paladins**, and **rangers** prepare a number of spells equal to their level + 2 spells each day.

**Bards**, **sorcerers**, and **wizards** prepare a number of spells equal to twice their level each day.

**Warlocks** prepare a number of spells equal to their level each day. Since a warlock only knows a number of spells equal to their level, this means a warlock always has all their spells prepared.

### Casting Spells

You can cast any spell you have prepared, even if you have cast it before. You are limited to the number of spells you have prepared. This means a 3rd-level cleric can cast 5 spells per day. Yes, this means that a 9th-level wizard can cast wish 18 times if she knows it an has it prepared.

Casting spells requires yogstones and a roll. This roll is against the current target number. It is:

_1d20 + the spellcasting ability + the character's proficiency bonus_

- On a **success**, you cast the spell and use it up.
- On a **failure**, you do not cast the spell but do not expend it.
- On a **criticl success**, you cast the spell to double effect and do not expend it.
- On a **critical failure**, you do not cast the spell and you do not expend it. But, bad stuff happens and your yogstone is reduced by one hit point.

### Cantrips

Cantrips are learned and cast as described in the core rules.

### Reskinning Spells

This is totally fine. Want to be able to cast a frostball intead of a fireball? Just change the damage type and do it!

## Levels and Experience

The magic system results in some classes being more powerful than others. This is fine, they will just advance slower. The table below shows the experience required to level for each class through 10th level.
