# Cards

The world is defined as a series of cards with connections to each other. Each card can have a target number. If it doesn't, it inherits the target number from its parent.

## Regions

These describe an navigable piece of terrain in the world such as the Misty Mountains or Murkwood. *Regions* have *sites*.

1. Expend the number of days defined on the card (probably a roll) to find a known *site* within an *region* or to traverse an *region*.
2. Check for random encounters as per the card.
3. Check to see if characters are lost.
4. If they are lost, go to step 1 and repeat until they get where they are going or are dead.
5. If they ar enot lost, then they have arrived.

When searching for a *site* the characters haven't been to before, the rolls are made with disadvantage. Maps of a *region* provide advantage when navigating and negate the disadvantage of seeking an unfamiliar site.

A **critical success** means the journey takes half the time. A **critical failure** results in some sort of bad outcome or event left to the wiles of the DM.

## Sites

These describe a site within an *region* such as Minas Morgul or Bree. *Sites* have *rooms*.

## Rooms

These describe a potentially tactical location such as the Bridge of Khazad-duÌ‚m or Shelob's Lair. Don't let the word *room* confuse you, this could be outdoors. Special rules for a *room* will be on the card. *Rooms* have *zones* within them.

- Anyone in the *room* can attack anyone else in the *room* with a ranged weapon unless something about the *room* prohibits it.

## Zones

A *zone* is a part of a *room*. It could be a bridge, a copse of trees, or a section of crowded stacks in a library.

- A *zone* can be crossed in a move. A dash is required to cross two *zones*.
- Anyone within a *zone* can attack and be attacked by anyone else in that *zone*.
